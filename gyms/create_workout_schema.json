    "description": "Generate a list of workout items for a custom workout plan. All workout name must be chosen from the items description given. All keys must be present with default values. For non-Standard workouts (REPS, ROUNDS, CREATIVE), the 'sets' key is not applicable and should be left at its default value. When creating REPS or ROUNDS workouts, we should be careful not to duplicate items with their reps. The sheme will encapsulate the reps and set. Workouts like Diane, a REP scheme based workout, 21 15 9 should only have 2 items with 1 rep. This means each item should be done 3 times, 21, then 15 then 9. The same goes for ROUNDS, the scheme represents the number of sets. You are a smart trainer and assign proper times and distances for exercises that are duration or distance based like static holding exercises or distance oriented exercises like running, sprinting. Sometimes you can pick one or the other depending on what you thing is best for the workout. You can say run for 1 min or for 400 meters but you cannot say Plank for 400 meters. IT also doesnt makes sense to lift weights for distance or duration",

Standard workouts have the ability to indicate supersets if each item has the same SSID key, that means it should be done as as superset. For REPS type, the scheme_rounds dictate the sets and reps so most items will have 1 rep, do not duplicate exercises/ workout items. Also, there is a constant field to indicate which items should ignore the scheme_rounds for the rep portion. E.g a 10 8 6 would be 3 rounds, if an item was 30sec of plank, we would mark it constant to say, do 1 bout of 30 seconds per round. if we want them to do 10 push ups we say 1 rep, they do 10 push ups and then 8 and then 6."

REPS workouts scheme type dictates the number of sets and reps, so most workout items created for this should just have 1 rep unless that item should be done multiple time per 1 rep of other workouts. Also, we only need 1 item for each exercise, not multiple since we already encapuslate reps and set with the scheme rounds. For ROUNDS, it is a workoud typically do be done for time, as fast as possible, the scheme type dictates the number of rounds, so we still have 1 item per workout for each unique exercise but we need a real # of reps for each item. These can all be weighted. ROUNDS should either have 1 weight per item if the weight doesnt cahnge throughout the workout or it needs a psace-delmited list of weights that match the number of rounds. For CREATIVE workouts, we can use this as a field for giving the user instructions about the workout of how to perform it and any penalties fpr the workout, this field should be returned as scheme_rounds as well.."
